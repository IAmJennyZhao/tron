# Ecorypto



In our ecosystem, we issued our own TRC20 token called ECO and crafted NFT (TRC721) for the avatar costumes and equipment. Users can use tokens to buy NFTs.

### EcoryptoNFT (ECON) (TRC721)
Our NFT follows the TRC721 ​​standard and stores the images on the Pinata IPFS system. Users can use ECO to mint and buy NFTs, or they can sell NFTs to get ECOs.

### Ecorypto (ECO) (TRC20)
The total supply is 1000000000 with 6 decimals. Our goal is to make a more eco-friendly environment, and it is crucial that we cannot make huge consumption and carbon emissions when we do the transaction. Tron is a more eco-friendly blockchain compared to the other PoS chain.

### Users actions reward 

A.Motivation: can record their actions through transactions,get related reward/incentives,and they also can mint NFT for sale.

B.User data verification:
